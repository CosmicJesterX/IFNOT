# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented here.

## [v0.1.0] - 2025-10-06

Initial docs-first release proposal.

- Rewrite README in a minimal, "void" tone while keeping safety and collaboration clear.
- Add a static `index.html` landing page (no JS, no build, accessible).
- Add this changelog to track releases.

Notes:

- No code-level integration is included yetâ€”this repo is documentation + static page.
- After merge, we can publish GitHub release `v0.1.0` based on `main`.

## [v0.0.1] - 2025-10-03

- Establish collaboration with Charlie Labs AI (PR #2).
