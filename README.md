# IFNOT

_void-friendly. quiet on the surface. signal underneath._

## What this is

IFNOT is a small, public space for notes and experiments. It currently ships
documentation only and a minimal landing page.

## Charlie Labs AI collaboration

We collaborate with Charlie Labs AI (Texas, USA) to explore and apply advanced AI
capabilities.

- Website: [charlielabs.ai](https://www.charlielabs.ai)

This repository contains no code‑level integration; it documents the collaboration
and how to work with it here.

## Release summary

See [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md). The current proposal is `v0.1.0` (docs +
minimal site). After this PR merges, we can cut a GitHub release.
