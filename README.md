# IFNOT

_void-friendly. quiet on the surface. signal underneath._

## What this is

IFNOT is a small, public space for notes and experiments. It currently ships
documentation only and a minimal landing page.

## Charlie Labs AI collaboration

We collaborate with Charlie Labs AI (Texas, USA) to explore and apply advanced AI
capabilities.

- Website: [charlielabs.ai](https://www.charlielabs.ai)

This repository contains no code‑level integration; it documents the collaboration
and how to work with it here.

## Release summary

See [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md). The current proposal is `v0.1.0` (docs +
minimal site). After this PR merges, we can cut a GitHub release.

<summary><strong>Copy palette (whimsical options)</strong></summary>

Use any of the lines below to swap the tagline under the title in this README
and the `<p class="tag">` line in `index.html`. Keep the rest minimal.

### Tagline options

- quiet surface. improbable ideas ripple underneath.
- anti‑noise. pro‑curiosity.
- void‑compatible. sparks permitted.
- tiny place for odd bright signals.
- empty on purpose. full of maybe.
- we plant question marks; see what grows.
- minimal surface area; maximal “what if?”.
- bring your own constellation.

### One‑liner (body) options

- Public notes and experiments. Light on ceremony; heavy on signal.
- A sketchbook for unlikely ideas.
- Small surface, long tail of possibilities.
- Notes that prefer whispers to drums.
- Quiet scaffolding for loud insights.
